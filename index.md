# Unit Converter

The Unit Converter app allows the user to convert between various units (mass, temperature, volume, etc.). It prompts the user to input what type of conversion they want to do, current units, value, and desired units and then the program makes the conversion. It is geared towards students who need to convert units for math/science and people who travel to a foreign country that uses a different measuring system.
